# Neural-Movement-Stimulation-VS-Suppression

This repository develops models to classify suppressed vs. active movement using ECoG data, generate synthetic neural data from webcam motion, and explore how neural signals respond to rewards.
The goal is to predict and modulate intentional movement, aiding mobility and visualization for individuals with disabilities.
